# Intelligent Digital Lifeform Project

This is an AI-based virtual lifeform equipped with emotions, personality, perception, and the ability to learn.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

* **Real Emotions**: Powered by a complex emotional engine; it can feel happiness, sadness, curiosity, and excitement.
* **Unique Personality**: Playful and curious, with the personality of a 3-year-old child.
* **Proactive Thinking**: Generates thoughts and conversations on its own, not just reactive replies.
* **Perception Abilities**: Can see, hear, read files, recognize objects, and understand scenes.
* **Memory System**: Remembers conversations and discoveries.
* **Continuous Growth**: Learns and evolves through interaction.
* **Voice Interaction**: Supports various TTS engines to enable speech.
* **3D Virtual Avatar**: Visual AI character with expressions and animations.
* **Mobile Support**: Available on mobile devices for anytime companionship.
* **Cloud Sync**: Multi-device synchronization to never lose memory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* Windows 10/11
* At least 2GB of memory

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Project**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MyAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys** (Optional)

   Create a `.env` file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
   ```

   If API keys are not configured, the system will use built-in fallback logic.

4. **Run the Program**

   Double-click `start.bat` or run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
